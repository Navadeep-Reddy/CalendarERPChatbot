# React-Shadcn-Tailwind-CSS-V4

A modern React project setup using **React 19**, **Shadcn/ui** for flexible UI components, and **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling. Powered by **Vite** as the build tool, this template is designed to help you quickly build fast and responsive web applications.

## 🚀 Features
- **React 19** for the latest React features and improvements
- **Shadcn/ui** for beautiful, reusable UI components
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first CSS, allowing for rapid UI development
- **Vite** for a blazing-fast development environment with hot reloading

## 🛠️ Setup

Follow these steps to get up and running with this template.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitnce1/React-Shadcn-Tailwind-CSS-V4.git
cd React-Shadcn-Tailwind-CSS-V4
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server using Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the project on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or another port, depending on your configuration).

## 🧩 Project Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the main folders and files:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the application
  - **components/**: Contains UI components (e.g., buttons, modals)
  - **App.jsx**: Main component where your app is bootstrapped
- **public/**: Static assets like images and icons
- **index.html**: Main HTML file for the app
- **jsconfig.json**: Configuration file for JavaScript path aliases
- **vite.config.js**: Vite configuration file
- **package.json**: Contains project dependencies and scripts

## 💅 Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured and ready to use. You can start applying utility classes directly in your JSX files.

## 🎨 Using Shadcn/ui Components

Shadcn/ui components are ready to be used. For example, to add a button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will create a new `Button` component in the `src/components/ui` directory.

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Vite Configuration**: Configured for fast development with support for React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Path Aliases**: You can use `@/` to refer to the `src/` folder in your imports, simplifying module paths.

## 🤖 Troubleshooting

- If you run into issues with dependencies, try running `npm install --force` to resolve conflicts.
- For any setup issues with Shadcn/ui components, you can always refer to the official Shadcn documentation for additional help.
